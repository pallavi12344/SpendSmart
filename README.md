# SpendSmart

I copy pasted the initial commit it is showing as my winform calculator. but this is the ASP.net Spendsmart project. 
we can create expenses and we will get the total amount. 
still need to add the db connection. the data is not getting stored anywhere. after rerunning the project your data will vanished.
